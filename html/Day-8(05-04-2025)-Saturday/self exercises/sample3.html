<div class="Games">
Games are structured activities, often involving rules, competition, and a goal, engaged in for entertainment or amusement,
and can be played alone or with others, physically or mentally

<div class="politics">
Politics may be used positively in the context of a "political solution" which is compromising and non-violent,[1] or descriptively as "the art or science of government", but the word often also carries a negative connotation.[2] The concept has been defined in various ways, and different approaches have fundamentally differing views on whether it should be used extensively or in a limited way, empirically or normatively, and on whether conflict or co-operation is more essential to it.
