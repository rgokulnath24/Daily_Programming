<h1>A Paragraph</h1>
<p>A paragraph is a distinct section of writing that focuses on a single idea or topic, typically consisting of several related sentences. It is usually indicated by an indent at the beginning of the first sentence. Paragraphs help to organize and structure writing, making it easier for readers to follow the author's ideas.</p>
