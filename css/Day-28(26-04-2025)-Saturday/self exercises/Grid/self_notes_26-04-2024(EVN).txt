A Grid

The Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns.

The Grid Layout Module makes it easier to design a responsive layout structure, without using float or positioning.

The CSS Grid Layout should be used for two-dimensional layout, with rows AND columns.

The CSS Flexbox Layout should be used for one-dimensional layout, with rows OR columns.


A grid always consists of:

a Grid Container - the parent (container) <div> element
Grid Items - the items inside the container <div>
